## Usage

This action sets up a Fortran compiler on Ubuntu, MacOS and Windows runners.

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest]
        toolchain:
          - {compiler: gcc, version: 11}
          - {compiler: intel-classic, version: '2021.10'}
        include:
          - os: ubuntu-latest
            toolchain: {compiler: intel, version: '2023.2'}
        exclude:
          - os: windows-latest
            toolchain: {compiler: intel-classic, version: '2021.10'}

    steps:
      - uses: awvwgk/setup-fortran@v1
        id: setup-fortran
        with:
          compiler: ${{ matrix.toolchain.compiler }}
          version: ${{ matrix.toolchain.version }}

      - run: ${{ env.FC }} --version
        env:
          FC: ${{ steps.setup-fortran.outputs.fc }}
```


## Options

- *compiler*: Compiler toolchain to setup, available options are
  - *gcc* (for `gfortran`)
  - *intel* (for `ifx`)
  - *intel-classic* (for `ifort`)
- *version*: Version of the compiler toolchain, available options are
  - *5–13* for *gcc*
  - *2021.1–2023.2* for *intel*
  - *2021.1–2021.10* for *intel-classic*

**Note:** version 13 of the GNU toolchain is not yet available on Windows.


## Outputs

The action sets the following outputs:

- `cc`: C compiler executable, e.g. `gcc`
- `fc`: Fortran compiler executable, e.g. `gfortran`


## Environment variables

The same values are also set as environment variables:

- `CC`
- `FC`

These are made available to subsequent workflow steps via the [`GITHUB_ENV` environment file mechanism](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/environment-variables#passing-values-between-steps-and-jobs-in-a-workflow).


## Runner compatibility

Support for the GCC toolchain varies across GitHub-hosted runner images.
